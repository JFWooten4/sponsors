Here you’ll find years of quotes distilled down to only the most motivational. The most impactful. The most fundamental truths we all must master to find success.

Enjoy,

I’ve been putting off publishing this book for the better part of six years. I feel silly writing it out like that, but it’s the truth. I’ve always loved learning about things on my own, as I suspect you do too, if you picked up this book.

Personal development, career expertise, and general success almost exclusively stem from a drive to learn about and specialize in a given field. This motivation can be internal or external, whether it’s a forced college degree or a lifelong passion for a particular subject.

If you feel forcefully cemented into your career or life circumstances... If you don’t have control over your daily actions and feel trapped in a self-fulfilling loop... If you just wish you had more freedom in your life... If you just want to take your current performance to the next level… This book is for you.

At the end of the day, the mindset changes you make today will permeate into your life for the rest of your days. I hope that these quotes will help you along your journey.


**Where do they come from?**

The quotes in this book come from essentially four or five years of consuming educational content. For instance, I might read ten or twenty books and uncover seven or eight incredibly meaningful takeaway quotes. Other times, I may listen to a few hundred hours of audio programs and discover four or five quotable main takeaways. Not to mention, I might get three or four big quotes from a weekend success or business seminar. You get the point.

I’ve cohobated hundreds of years of collective experience in this collection of quotes. May they bring you great fortune, determination, and success.

The opportunity to share my experiences and knowledge along with my passion to inspire others is what motivated me to write this book.

Anthony Morrison

At the end of the day, it’s our responsibilities to share with others the biggest takeaways we discover in life. I remember launching my first startup a few years ago. For the first six months of development, I was uber-secretive about what our business plan was. I freaked myself into a scarcity mindset. When you let fear rule your life, leadership becomes almost impossible. Fear of others stealing your ideas. Fear of market crashes. Fear of black-swan events. Once you overcome internal emotions, you can start making plans to succeed. How can I protect my IP? What would need to happen for X to fail? Could Y really mean Z? That last question helped my Fund short the market on short-expiration high-leverage contracts in Feb. 2020. 

Transparency is geometrically easier to succeed with that close-mindedness. Honesty with yourself, those around you, and (most importantly) those who seek to learn from you. Be open and share the knowledge you have. Unless it’s a $12B trading algo, you’ll almost always find that sharing with others only enhances your own understanding of your trade. When it came to my first startup, I finally started telling people what we did and instantly expected them to start copying me ‘it was such a great idea.’ But nobody did. I realized that there are such an incredibly small number of people on this planet who think the EXACT same way as you. Dozens of VCs passed on Uber, AirBNB, etc. because they didn’t share the same vision. They didn’t see the same potential. They didn’t have the expertise or connections needed to see these unicorns for what they could be—and that’s completely normal! If everyone you meet says your idea is great, ditch it. Nothing really worth doing is uncontroversial. But the development and growth process becomes significantly simpler when you’re transparent with your knowledge.

I get deathly afraid whenever I see any project even remotely related to decentralized asset management. There’s this little voice that goes “Crap, they beat me to my dream, it’ll never happen for me, etc etc.” But then I realize that it takes such a specialized understanding of financial markets to implement what I truly desire that I would happily see someone else develop my goals before me. But I know it won’t happen because nobody else is me. Thatliberates your ability to happily share information with others knowing that related knowledge will come back to you ten-fold.

I know guys who are worth ten times what I am worth. I know billionaires. And not one person who has proven more successful than me has ever once suggested that I do or work less. The only people who have suggested I not be so obsessed are ordinary people committed to average lives.

You are creative to the degree you are committed. And you are successful to the degree that you make that commitment known to the world.

By focusing on what you can control and not worrying about the things you can't, you keep progressing... better to track an important leading indicator subjectively than track a bad one accurately.

At foot speed, the Sierra Nevada seemed just barely surmountable. I could always take another step. It was only when I rounded a bend and glimpsed the white peaks ahead that I doubted my abilities, only when I thought how far I had yet to go that I lost faith that I would get there.

When you teach something, you learn it twice.

— Stefan James

Marketing to values is more powerful than the marketing of products.

— Dan Kennedy

---

[A ten-year goal] is not a shortcut; it's a faster track... When you have a vision, you start living intentionally. It starts choosing your friends for you. It teaches you what to say yes to. It teaches you what to say no to. It holds you accountable to you, and it increases your confidence when you start progressing through your visions... You're telling yourself that you trust you.

— Joel Brown

---

You can have all the strategies and everything else, but if you're not confident in your craft, if you're not confident in you being able to deliver, if you don't believe that you're resourceful enough to make things happen, then it's going to be a tough road... with a lot of second-guessing.

Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.

— Gary Keller with Jay Papasan

---

A successful business starts not with just a great idea or product. Rather, it starts with the desire to provide a solution to another's problem. In doing so you enrich your own life and the lives of those around you, your family and employees or employers, by enriching the lives of your clients.

Pale ink is better than the most retentive memory... Write it down... We forget what we hear in four hours.

Discipline is more important than motivation.

It's not important to play every instrument. It's important to be the organizer.

— Stephen Larson

---

A business is nothing more than a series of systems that gets leads and converts them into sales.

— Stephen Larson

Know you have this greatness inside of you... If you see a bird on a tree, the bird is not confident because it puts its trust on a tree branch. It's confident because it puts its trust in its own wings.

— Jim Kwik

---

There's no failure. There's only failure to learn... Be consistent with your learning. Readers are leaders... The biggest obstacle to reading besides focus is sub-vocalization... You ever notice when you're reading something to yourself and you hear that inner voice inside your head reading along with you?... The reason why it keeps you reading slow is, if you have to say all the words inside your mind to understand it... your reading speed is limited to your talking speed, not your thinking speed. That's why you can listen to audiobooks at 2x, 3x. You can process that fast, you just can't speak that fast. But the truth is you don't have to pronounce words to understand them... [once] you've seen those words hundreds of thousands of times they become sight words.

— Jim Kwik

---

You've got to constantly examine and evaluate everything you're doing and reverse engineer it... The data will tell you exactly what to do or what not to do if you ask the right questions by doing the right kinds of tests.

— Jay Abraham

---

Alex Van Halen has said that when he would go out at night his brother Eddie would be sitting on his bed practicing the guitar, and when he came home many hours later Eddie would still be in the same place, still practicing. That's the journey of mastery—it never ends.

Diamond is formed under extreme pressure.

Don't think about how. Just answer the question. What does it look like? What is the destination.

— Brian Scudamore

---

People don't fail. Systems do... Anyone should be able to pick up on one page how you do things... Pilots have flown hundreds, hopefully thousands of times, but they still take that laminated checklist and they go "check, check, check, check, check..." to ensure that the best practice is followed and done each and every time so you don't have to make a mistake.

— Brian Scudamore

---

No company is too big to fail.

— Dan Lok

[Tank Tip] Take advantage of all the resources you can. I didn't know a lot about running a business when I first started, but thanks to SCORE (the Service Core of Retired Executives) I was able to get some really amazing free help. Resources like that can make a huge difference.

— Tracey Noonan

---

It doesn't matter how many times you strike out. No one is going to know or care about your failures, and neither should you.

— Mark Cuban

---

All you have to do is learn. Everything I read was public. Anyone could buy the same books and magazines. The same information was available to anyone who wanted it. Turns out most people didn't want it.

— Mark Cuban

---

Empower the people around you... Their success is your success... Their failure is your failure.

— Michael Parrella

---

Build a base of knowledge to fall back on... Fire up the computer and spend your time reading, learning, growing, because when life throws you a lifeline—and it will—you won't be able to grab on if you're too busy twiddling your thumbs.

— Michael Parrella

---

Rome also didn't fall in a day.

— Mike Moosbrugger

---

If I don't understand something, then I'm going to keep on asking you because my Mom told me that if I don't understand something to keep on asking questions until I do.

— Warren Moon

---

We don't ask questions because we get embarrassed... Be more interested and interesting. Ask one more question... That one most valuable question could change your life or perspective.

— David Meltzer

---

I don't get ready. I stay ready.

— Will Smith

---

When you do the hard stuff, life becomes easy.

Consciously choose the opportunities in your life.

— Russell Brunson

---

Your ability to make money is directly tied to your ability to market. What is marketing? Marketing is the act of changing beliefs with the intent of a purchase. How do you change beliefs? Storytelling.

— Stephen Larsen

---

What we have are systems. Not rules. Rules create robots. Not systems. Systems are predetermined ways to achieve a result. The emphasis has to be on achieving the result, not the system for the system's sake... We have rules about smoking within ten feet of a gasoline pump. We have systems for delivering service.

— Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles

---

Where are we going to be in twenty years? I don't know. But I have to think we'll find our motivation as we grow. Because, let's face it, there are lots of successful people out there who continue to grind and hustle, long after they've made it. [Don't stop]

— Kramer Laplante

---

There are two types of pain you will go through in life: the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.

— Jim Rohn

---

For ten years, I got my hair cut by this person... [who always] told me her problems. She talked about her marriage. She was having a pride problem, and I tried to help her with it, but I always left feeling drained. Finally... I couldn't have the idea of seeing her like this, every time. So I made that change. All of that negativity, it can pull you down, so I try not to be around negative people so consistently. Time is too short, and it can be a real drain.

— Joel Osteen

---

Incorporating multiple success approaches together vastly multiplies your achievements, minimizes your shortfalls, and compresses your timeline to achieving any goal.

— Jay Abraham

---

The path you've chosen is full of many highs and lows... and while it's rare you'll uncover "right" answers or "perfect" choices, there is one constant you can rely on: your own ability to persist and persevere... With hard work, discipline, and focus, tremendous rewards await. It's you who's in control of your future—no one else.

— Michael Parrish DuDell

---

The meaning of life is in the conversations we're having right now, and you can have the same conversation with a waiter or janitor or an executive at a top company. It's all in the process.

— Daymond John

---

Don't tell me you can't do something or move into an area where you don't have any expertise. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean you can't do it... Maybe you're a little short, a little slow, or can't cut it on the floor... Stay in the game, either as a coach, manager, front office guy, marketing guy, or whatever.

— Daymond John

---

To make any kind of profit we had to get our line placed in the national chains—but for us to make that happen we... weakened our relationship with our customers. Forget what it did to our profit margins, because that was part of the trade-off too, but the real cost to us over time was our authenticity.

— Daymond John

Whatever your habits are when you start will be your habits forever.

— Russell Brunson

---

Just the act and the motion of you moving forward working on stuff is opening doors and making other stuff happen.

— Russell Brunson

---

Where I grew up from, nobody expected much from me, so I didn't do much... The reason why I'm so successful now is that I expect more from myself than anyone can imagine... The more you expect from yourself, the more you're gonna achieve.

— Russell Brunson

---

To be attractive to some also, by definition, means you are unattractive to others. You gotta be okay with that... This is what I stand for.

— Stephen Larsen

---

Successful people doubt their doubts and believe their beliefs... Create an environment that saves you when you don't feel motivated.

— Stephen Larsen

---

Even though you didn't achieve the thing you want yet, you felt achievement which then drives you forward to do the next thing and the next thing and the next thing... Micro-achievements get you to the goal in the end.

— Russell Brunson

Winners win.

— Gary Vee

Pressure makes diamonds; it can't be bad.

— Grant Cardone

I've been poor, and I've been on the other side of poor. It takes as much energy to stay poor as it does to get rich. It's just work either way.

Anything worth doing once is worth doing every day.

Success is your duty, obligation, and responsibility.

— Grant Cardone

We've all got some kind of expiration date on our lives. Fly too close to the sun for too long, and you'll be unnoticed; find the right balance between flying just high enough, at just the right velocity, and you might just stay up there forever.

---

There's nothing sadder than to see someone get to be seventy-five or eighty years old and look back regretfully because they pursued the wrong target.

— Jay Abraham

We live in a culture that places tremendous value on independence and self-reliance. But knowing how and when to ask for help, especially when it's hard, is one of the most valuable lessons you can learn. A great mentor can play an influential role in your personal life and the life of your business. Seek out a relationship with someone in your community whom you respect and trust.

— Michael Parrish DuDell

---

The fastest way to get from where you are to where you want to be is to hire a coach. There is no faster way to get from where you are to where you want to be other than hiring a coach... When you pay somebody for their skill set to guide you through the process, there is a symbol of seriousness that allows them to support you through the process... A mentor has been there and mentor can show you the shortest path, but a coach can show you the fastest path. That's the difference between Google Maps and Waze... The mentor has been there and can say, "Don't do these three things, do this." But you have no idea if there's traffic on that road at that time. Mentors can always give you the shortest path because they have perspective, but coaches know what is working right now. If someone wanted to double the size of their business, I could probably help them do it much faster than they could do on their own.

— Daniel Uzamire

---

All I had to do was hire my first coach ten years earlier, and the trajectory of my company would have been completely different. My life would have been completely different.

— Sharran Srivatsaa

---

I had $1,568 in the bank, and the only reason why I know that number is that the cost to hire this coach was $1,500 a month... It was one of the biggest and scared decisions I made... Many many years later, I can tell you that I would have spent $15,000 to make that same decision knowing what I know now. That single decision to hire a mentor or hire a coach changed every aspect of my life... The things that I learned from that mentor bled into other aspects of my life. It wasn't just about business. It actually affected my relationships. It affected me personally. And now I can't imagine not having a mentor. I thought I was broke. I thought I was weird. I was paying somebody to teach me things that I should know inherently or that I should know, and I come to find out that sometimes we don't know those things inherently. Sometimes they're not natural to us, and it is very wise to hire a mentor. The more I looked into it the more I realized that the most successful people in the world in any category: the most successful musicians, the most successful athletes, the most successful investors, the most successful parents. People that are successful that have reached a level of greatness are coached and mentored and they never stop the mentoring. Tiger Woods... still has a hiring coach. Michael Jordan... had a shooting coach. Warren Buffet has investment coaches. Mentorship, what I found out, isn't for people that are broken. Mentorship is for people that want to excel. When you get to a certain level and you can't break through that, we call it the plateau, you need to bring somebody in that can bring you above that plateau... It's something I got really passionate about and wish I did earlier in my career... It's one of the greatest secrets of the successful. They are coached and mentored at every aspect and it never stops... I spent the last money in my bank account... and I would have done it again 100 times over to have the same result.

— Ryan Jaden

The plateaus are where the death starts, so I need to keep the focus on possibility and potential.

— Grant Cardone

If you aren't serious enough to invest in your business [or yourself], who else will be?

— Misha Wilson

---

I got resourceful and actually came up with well over $10,000 by borrowing from someone. I didn't have any credit. No credit lines. Didn't have any financing options. None of it. But I came up with the money and started that mentorship program. It totally changed my life. Very shortly after that I built my first six-figure per year business and I've just kind of gone from there... God, I wish I would have done it earlier... There's a huge cost to not being started with mentoring.

— Misha Wilson

---

Success is on the other side of a yes [that results in temporary discomfort]. Nothing is on the other side of a no.

— Ryan Jaden

---

Don't be afraid to spend money. It's a mindset issue. Don't be afraid to invest in yourself... You should invest in yourself more than anything. The more you invest in yourself, the more you become. The more you become, the more you can give back to others.

— Rich Guzman

---

Seek mentors. I have a lot of people I talk to on a regular basis, people I talk to all the time, people who have been there and done that.

— Brian Lee

Once you go through that door, go through that door boldly.
