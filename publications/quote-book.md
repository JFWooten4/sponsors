— Unknown, League of Legends



Society grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.

— Greek Proverb

# We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.
# A vast majority of everything we know…
# Comes from those who precede us…
# Mentors, books, history, you name it. Everything today comes from what once was.

## This book is small, but impactful. Slender, but life-changing.



Here you’ll find years of quotes distilled down to only the most motivational. The most impactful. The most fundamental truths we all must master to find success.



Enjoy,

 
I’ve been putting off publishing this book for the better part of six years. I feel silly writing it out like that, but it’s the truth. I’ve always loved learning about things on my own, as I suspect you do too, if you picked up this book.

Personal development, career expertise, and general success almost exclusively stem from a drive to learn about and specialize in a given field. This motivation can be internal or external, whether it’s a forced college degree or a lifelong passion for a particular subject.

If you feel forcefully cemented into your career or life circumstances... If you don’t have control over your daily actions and feel trapped in a self-fulfilling loop... If you just wish you had more freedom in your life... If you just want to take your current performance to the next level… This book is for you.

At the end of the day, the mindset changes you make today will permeate into your life for the rest of your days. I hope that these quotes will help you along your journey.



WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?

	The quotes in this book come from essentially four or five years of consuming educational content. For instance, I might read ten or twenty books and uncover seven or eight incredibly meaningful takeaway quotes. Other times, I may listen to a few hundred hours of audio programs and discover four or five quotable main takeaways. Not to mention, I might get three or four big quotes from a weekend success or business seminar. You get the point.

	I’ve cohobated hundreds of years of collective experience in this collection of quotes. May they bring you great fortune, determination, and success.

The opportunity to share my experiences and knowledge along with my passion to inspire others is what motivated me to write this book.

Anthony Morrison

At the end of the day, it’s our responsibilities to share with others the biggest takeaways we discover in life. I remember launching my first startup a few years ago. For the first six months of development, I was uber-secretive about what our business plan was. I freaked myself into a scarcity mindset. When you let fear rule your life, leadership becomes almost impossible. Fear of others stealing your ideas. Fear of market crashes. Fear of black-swan events. Once you overcome internal emotions, you can start making plans to succeed. How can I protect my IP? What would need to happen for X to fail? Could Y really mean Z? That last question helped my Fund short the market on short-expiration high-leverage contracts in Feb. 2020. 

Transparency is geometrically easier to succeed with that close-mindedness. Honesty with yourself, those around you, and (most importantly) those who seek to learn from you. Be open and share the knowledge you have. Unless it’s a $12B trading algo, you’ll almost always find that sharing with others only enhances your own understanding of your trade. When it came to my first startup, I finally started telling people what we did and instantly expected them to start copying me ‘it was such a great idea.’ But nobody did. I realized that there are such an incredibly small number of people on this planet who think the EXACT same way as you. Dozens of VCs passed on Uber, AirBNB, etc. because they didn’t share the same vision. They didn’t see the same potential. They didn’t have the expertise or connections needed to see these unicorns for what they could be—and that’s completely normal! If everyone you meet says your idea is great, ditch it. Nothing really worth doing is uncontroversial. But the development and growth process becomes significantly simpler when you’re transparent with your knowledge.

I get deathly afraid whenever I see any project even remotely related to decentralized asset management. There’s this little voice that goes “Crap, they beat me to my dream, it’ll never happen for me, etc etc.” But then I realize that it takes such a specialized understanding of financial markets to implement what I truly desire that I would happily see someone else develop my goals before me. But I know it won’t happen because nobody else is me. That liberates your ability to happily share information with others knowing that related knowledge will come back to you ten-fold.



Man may be born in poverty, but he does not have to go through life in poverty.

Andrew Carnegie

 

The reason I'm successful is because I outworked everyone else... You only have to be right once—one single, solitary time—and you are set for life. That's the beauty of the business world. Just get it right once.

Mark Cuban

 

As soon as you stop trying to learn and grow, it's so fast. It's so easy to become irrelevant... Study a lot because you're not above it.

Russell Brunson

 

Leaders are readers. The only way you can succeed is if you read... Who are your leaders and where are they taking you?

Daniel Ally

Aristotle

 

If you look back on yourself a year ago and aren't shocked by how stupid you were, you haven't learned much.

Ray Dalio

 

You are a rounding error.

Alexis Ohanian

 

The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much off your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right.

Neil Gaiman

 

If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.

Create your own rules.

Dan Sullivan

 

I'd rather be wrong and rich than right and broke.

Russell Brunson

 

Management is mostly about "to do" lists (can't live without them!). Leadership is about tapping the wellsprings of human motivation—and about fundamental relations with one's fellows.

Tom Peters

 

The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.

Tim Ferriss

 

There are two necessary conditions to become an entrepreneur: absolute confidence and total ignorance.

Dan Sullivan

Chip and Dan Heath

 

Life in not waiting for the storm to pass, it's learning how to dance in the rain.

Vivian Greene

 

You have to act first before inspiration will hit. You don't wait for inspiration and then act, or you're never going to act, because you're never going to have the inspiration, not consistently.

Robert Rodriguez

 

A couple months of really hard, focused effort will pay you forever... Create something amazing.

Russell Brunson

 

The simple willingness to improvise is more vital, in the long run, than research.

Rolf Potts

 

Meditation is like sweating at the gym. Minus the sweating. And the gym.

Chade-Meng Tan

 

Set your course of possibility. And then fuel your engine with the highest octane stuff you can get your hands on.

Grant Cardone

 

Look at what's in your windshield and disregard the rearview mirrors.

Grant Cardone

 

I know guys who are worth ten times what I am worth. I know billionaires. And not one person who has proven more successful than me has ever once suggested that I do or work less. The only people who have suggested I not be so obsessed are ordinary people committed to average lives.

Grant Cardone

 

You are creative to the degree you are committed. And you are successful to the degree that you make that commitment known to the world.

Grant Cardone

 

Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.

Thomas Edison

 

If you look around, you'll see that we have a lot of people calling themselves leaders who don't have any control.

Grant Cardone

 

It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

Grant Cardone

 

Persistence is the characteristic of legends, greats, and geniuses who were called crazy because they didn't quit when the average person would have.

Grant Cardone

 

What and whom you pay attention to is worth more than what you spend your dollars on. Money, power, fame, and success all follow attention, so what gets the most attention is what will grow.

Grant Cardone

 

Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.

Malcolm Gladwell

 

I see my success in terms of relationships... Our friends become clients and our clients become friends.

Mo Bunnell

 

By focusing on what you can control and not worrying about the things you can't, you keep progressing... better to track an important leading indicator subjectively than track a bad one accurately.

Mo Bunnell

 

Learn to love fear. Fear is an indication of what you should do, not what you shouldn't do.

Grant Cardone

 

We have everything we need in other to success, but we have to take the things that we have to get more of the things we want.

Daniel Ally

 

It's easier to put your head down and just work than face the things you need to work on.

Dan Lok

 

We have success so quickly by finding people who have already succeeded and modeling them.

Russell Brunson

Jason Capital

 

The steeper the growth, the easier it was.

Sharran Srivatsaa

 

Fear has no place on paper.

Sharran Srivatsaa

 

The very first thing you need to do is adopt an identity. What is the identity of somebody who already has the habit that you want?

James Friel

 

Align your expectations with what you think is reasonable, and then consistently do small simple things to get there... Do not uproot the plant before it has a chance to start sprouting.

James Friel

 

At foot speed, the Sierra Nevada seemed just barely surmountable. I could always take another step. It was only when I rounded a bend and glimpsed the white peaks ahead that I doubted my abilities, only when I thought how far I had yet to go that I lost faith that I would get there.

Cheryl Strayed

 

I freed 1000 slaves, but I could have freed 1000 more, if only they knew they were slaves.

Harriet Tubman

 

When you teach something, you learn it twice.

Stefan James

 

Marketing to values is more powerful than the marketing of products.

Dan Kennedy

 

[A ten-year goal] is not a shortcut; it's a faster track... When you have a vision, you start living intentionally. It's starts choosing your friends for you. It teaches you what to say yes to. It teaches you what to say no to. It holds you accountable to you, and it increases your confidence when you start progressing through your visions... You're telling yourself that you trust you.

Joel Brown

 

You can have all the strategies and everything else, but if you're not confident in your craft, if you're not confident in you being able to deliver, if you don't believe that your resourceful enough to make things happen, then it's going to be a tough road... with a lot of second guessing

Joel Brown

 

Who I am today is a result of the mentors, the coaches, the books, the resources. The more that you learn, the more you earn. The more you stand on the shoulders of giants, the faster you get to where you want to be.

Stefan James

 

I'm not the smartest. I'm not the brightest. But, damn, I am the most consistent.

Dan Lok

 

The primary difference between the rich, the poor, and the middle class is what they do in their spare time.

Entrepreneurs start with passion, move to a purpose, and then think about profitability... There's a difference between an innovator and a business person. I always use the McDonald's brothers as an example.

If you can't put it on a bumper sticker, the guy behind you will never figure it out.

Daymond John

 

Successful, driven, and hungry people don't wait for someone to "give" them a job—they go out and get work.

Russell Brunson

 

Your inner world reflects your outter world.

T. Harv Eker

 

To-do lists inherently lack the invent of success... not making each day a stepping-stone for the next so that you sequentially build a successful life.

Gary Keller with Jay Papasan

 

Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.

Gary Keller with Jay Papasan

 

A successful business starts not with just a great idea or product. Rather, it starts with the desire to provide a solution to another's problem. In doing so you enrich your own life and the lives of those around you, your family and employees or employers, by enriching the lives of your clients.

Although you have failures, a lot of people that have succeeded with you will discount your failures because they know your character, they know your discipline, and they know your skills.

Talk to your end user before you start to develop.

Anik Singal

 

If you die someday with a skill or an expertise in your head and you don't share it, I think you should feel guilty.

Dean Graziosi

 

The best way to change the world is to impact one person who impacts two other people who impacts two other people who impacts two other people.

Blair LaCorte

 

The only dumb question is the one that you don't ask.

Harvey Mackay

 

Pale ink is better than the most retentive memory... Write it down... We forget what we hear in four hours.

Harvey Mackay

 

Discipline is more important than motivation.

Stephen Larson

 

It's not important to play every instrument. It's important to be the organizer.

Stephen Larson

 

A business is nothing more than a series of systems that gets leads and converts them into sales.

Stephen Larson

 

Know you have this greatness inside of you... If you see a bird on a tree, the bird is not confident because it puts its trust on a tree branch. It's confident because it puts it's trust in it's own wings.

Jim Kwik

 

There's no failure. There's only failure to learn... Be consistent with your learning. Readers are leaders... The biggest obstacle to reading besides focus is sub-vocalization... You ever notice when you're reading something to yourself and you hear that inner voice inside your head reading along with you?... The reason why it keeps you reading slow is, if you have to say all the words inside your mind to understand it... your reading speed is limited to your talking speed, not your thinking speed. That's why you can listen to audiobooks at 2x, 3x. You can process that fast, you just can't speak that fast. But the truth is you don't have to pronounce words to understand them... [once] you've seen those words hundreds of thousands of times they become sight words.

Jim Kwik

 

You've got to constantly examine and evaluate everything you're doing and reverse engineer it... The data will tell you exactly what to do or what not to do if you ask the right questions by doing the right kinds of tests.

Jay Abraham

 

Alex Van Halen has said that when he would go out at night his brother Eddie would be sitting on his bed practicing the guitar, and when he came home many hours later Eddie would still be in the same place, still practicing. That's the journey of mastery—it never ends.

Gary Keller with Jay Papasan

 

You don't have the right to determine what the market wants. But you have the duty to find out.

Jay Abraham

 

Some people freeze to death in the winter. People that are prepared might snowboard or ski and have a good time.

Tony Robbins

 

You have to put yourself on the line to live a quality life.

Tony Robbins

 

Just start. Your people will find you as you find your voice.

Russell Brunson

 

The safety net that allows a consumer to jump into a purchase without fear is popularity.

Dan Lok

 

You can't hit a target you don't see.

Daymond John

 

Passion wins! And if it works out that your passion can also bring meaningful change and grow into a substantial business... well, then you're good to go.

Daymond John

 

Diamond is formed under extreme pressure.

Dan Lok

 

Don't think about how. Just answer the question. What does it look like? What is the destination.

Brian Scudamore

 

People don't fail. Systems do... Anyone should be able to pick up on one page how you do things... Pilots have flown hundreds, hopefully thousands of times, but they still take that laminated checklist and they go "check, check, check, check, check..." to ensure that the best practice is followed and done each and every time so you don't have to make a mistake.

Brian Scudamore

 

No company is too big to fail.

Dan Lok

 

[Tank Tip] Take advantage of all the resources you can. I didn't know a lot about running a business when I first started, but thanks to SCORE (the Service Core of Retired Executives) I was able to get some really amazing free help. Resources like that can make a huge difference.

Tracey Noonan

 

It doesn't matter how many times you strike out. No one is going to know or care about your failures, and neither should you.

Mark Cuban

 

All you have to do is learn. Everything I read was public. Anyone could buy the same books and magazines. The same information was avaliable to anyone who wanted it. Turns out most people didn't want it.

Mark Cuban

 

Empower the people around you... Their success is your success... Their failure is your failure.

Michael Parrella

 

Build a base of knowledge to fall back on... Fire up the computer and spend your time reading, learning, growing, because when life throws you a lifeline—and it will—you won't be able to grab on if you're too busy twiddling your thumbs.

Michael Parrella

 

Rome also didn't fall in a day.

Mike Moosbrugger

 

If I don't understand something, then I'm going to keep on asking you because my Mom told me that if I don't understand something to keep on asking questions until I do.

Warren Moon

 

We don't ask questions because we get embarrassed... Be more interested and interesting. Ask one more question... That one most valuable question could change your life or perspective.

David Meltzer

 

I don't get ready. I stay ready.

Will Smith

 

When you do the hard stuff, life becomes easy.

Jim Kwik

 

In today's world, knowledge is not only power; it's profit... You're not paid for your brute strength solely; you're paid for brain strength... The faster you can learn the faster you can earn.

Jim Kwik

 

People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

Jim Kwik

 

There's no room for regret in your casket.

Jim Carry

 

Funny means money... and strengthens your relationships.

Karyn Buxman

 

Don't be good. Good is the energy of greatness. Don't be good; be awesome.

Russell Brunson

 

Consciously choose the opportunities in your life.

Russell Brunson

 

Your ability to make money is directly tied to your ability to market. What is marketing? Marketing is the act of changing beliefs with the intent of a purchase. How do you change beliefs? Storytelling.

Stephen Larsen

 

What we have are systems. Not rules. Rules create robots. Not systems. Systems are predetermined ways to achieve a result. The emphasis has to be on achieving the result, not the system for the system's sake... We have rules about smoking within ten feet of a gasoline pump. We have systems for delivering service.

Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles

 

Where are we going to be in twenty years? I don't know. But I have to think we'll find our motivation as we grow. Because, let's face it, there are lots of successful people out there who continue to grind and hustle, long after they've made it. [Don't stop]

Kramer Laplante

 

There are two types of pain you will go through in life: the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.

Jim Rohn

 

For ten years, I got my hair cut by this person... [who always] told me her problems. She talked about her marriage. She was having a pride problem, and I tried to help her with it, but I always left feeling drained. Finally... I couldn't have the idea of seeing her like this, every time. So I made that change. All of that negativity, it can pull you down, so I try not to be around negative people so consistently. Time is too short, and it can be a real drain.

Joel Osteen

 

Incorporating multiple success approaches together vastly multiplies your achievements, minimizes your shortfalls, and compromises your timeline to achieving any goal.

Jay Abraham

 

The path you've chosen is full of many highs and lows... and while it's rare you'll uncover "right" answers or "perfect" choices, there is one constant you can rely on: your own ability to persist and persevere... With hard work, discipline, and focus give tremendous rewards. It's you who's in control of your future—no one else.

Michael Parrish DuDell

 

The meaning of life is in conversations we're having right now, and you can have the same conversation with a waiter or janitor or an executive at a top company. It's all in the process.

Daymond John

 

Don't tell me you can't do something or move into an area where you don't have any expertise. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean you can't do it... Maybe you're a little short, a little slow, or can't cut it on the floor... Stay in the game, either as a coach, manager, front office guy, marketing guy, or whatever.

Daymond John

 

To make any kind of profit we had to get our line placed in the national chains—but for us to make that happen we... weakend our relationship with out customers. Forget what it did to our profit margins, because that was part of the trade-off too, but the real cost to us over time was our authenticity.

Daymond John

 

Whatever your habits are when you start will be your habits forever.

Russell Brunson

 

Just the act and the motion of you moving forward working on stuff is opening doors and making other stuff happen.

Russell Brunson

 

Where I grew up from, nobody expected much from me, so I didn't do much... The reason why I'm so successful now is that I expect more from myself than anyone can imagine... The more you expect from yourself, the more you're gonna achieve.

Russell Brunson

 

To be attractive to some also, by definition, means you are unattractive to others. You gotta be okay with that... This is what I stand for.

Stephen Larsen

 

Successful people doubt their doubts and believe their beliefs... Create an environment that saves you when you don't feel motivated.

Stephen Larsen

 

Even though you didn't achieve the thing you want yet, you felt achievement which then drives you forward to do the next thing and the next thing and the next thing... Micro-achievements get you to the goal in the end.

Russell Brunson

 

Winners win.

Gary Vee

 

Pressure makes diamonds; it can't be bad.

Grant Cardone

 

I've been poor, and I've been on the other side of poor. It takes as much energy to stay poor as it does to get rich. It's just work either way.

Grant Cardone

 

Anything worth doing once is worth doing every day.

Great Cardone

 

You're probably charging too little.

Mike Buontempo

 

Time past and time future what might have been and what has been point to one end, which is always present.

T.S. Eliot

 

No, dear friends, I am still not all I should be but I am focusing all my energies in this one thing: forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.

Philippians 3:13

 

People don't like doing the easy things. They like doing the hard things.

Start a speech the same way you start a story to a child... Once upon a time.

Be ethical, but don't play fair.

Grant Cardone

 

Success is your duty, obligation, and reasonability.

Grant Cardone



What a marketer does when his ads no longer pull as well as they did shows his true character. You have to be innovative. You must get the response back to where it was. In this business, you’re either growing or dying.

Vince James



I remember getting my first employee… boy was it strange… especially since she was in her mid-40s and I was a 21-year-old high-school drop out!

We get so wrapped up in our day-to-day experiences that we don’t even think for a second what it would mean to the people around us to actually hear us give a shit.

Garret White



The unreasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

Georgia Shaw



Always say what you really think instead of trying to read the room.

Liz Dolan



If you want to serve something cold, serve it ice cold—dry ice cold—to the point where it burns. If it's supposed to be hot, burn the roof is their mouth with it. Intensity covers up a lot of fragilities... That's how our organization operates. A [daily] intensity to win.

Jerry Jones Jr



Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you."

Garrett White



Learn to move between worlds. If people called me William, they know me from school. If they call me Willie they know me from my neighborhood. If they call me Will, it's work.

The job of the navigator is to see as far into the future as you can. To make decisions that are going to protect your crew and your vessel. And to make sure you're going on the right path.

Lehua Kamalu



Above all, we must always look to the future. Foresee the future of new inventions. Be unafraid is the new. Delete from our vocabulary the word 'impossible.'

Giovanni Agnelli



You can take on Goliaths and win, but only if you know exactly what your advantage is.

Reid Hoffman



Being contrarian and right is a truly winning combination.

Reid Hoffman



Your disruptive wave may initially set all the boats on a lake bobbing up and down frantically, and it could upturn them. But it could also raise the water level higher for everyone.

Reid Hoffman



Do you not realize that you're gonna be dead forever?... Do you not realize that relative to how long you're gonna be dead, you're gonna be alive for about a minute? Why in the world would you do something you don't want to do?

Jordan Harbinger



A vast majority of the problems that executives and high-level professionals and entrepreneurs face in business have almost nothing to do with what's going on in the business... Your business results are linked up directly to how life is going for you outside of business.

Garrett White



If we lower prices for one client, it's just a matter of time until the others find out and demand the same... The light at the end if the tunnel was just a train.

Eliyahu Goldratt



I've failed over and over again, and that is why I succeed.

Michael Jordan



None of this stuff really matters that much.

Russell Brunson



You shouldn't feel fatigued by the repetition. You should celebrate your single-mindedness. Your focus. You can never know the full reach of your first idea. It could span your entire career.

Reid Hoffman



The hardest ideas are often the most scalable.

Reid Hoffman



You—you're going to be amazing at sales. 60% is your attitude and the way you connect with people.

Daniel Uzamire



Easy isn't always good.... Go out of your way to succeed... It's all you in Nigeria. Anywhere... Come together and form groups... They will murder you if you steal... Civilians will shove you into a tire and set you on fire.

Daniel Uzamire



It is easier to start a hard company than an easy company.

Sam Altman



Being original is overrated. The most creative minds in the world... are just better at rearrangement.

Jeff Goins



You can bring someone to a specific point to do what you want then to do, but you can't force them to do it.

Jim Edwards



I’m always taking notes… I’m always writing things down because I know the value of keeping ideas organized and well-ordered so that I can use them to the highest advantage… write your ideas down because a dull pencil is better than a sharp mind.

Daniel Ally



Don’t make a to-do list… Make a not-to-do list. Just have one thing. If you just focus on one thing, you don’t need to write it down because you’ve got it in your head… Just do it!

Richard Koch



Few things really matter, but they matter a tremendous amount.

Richard Koch



I was referred to as retarded, developmentally disabled, failure to thrive. And I heard all those things from teachers… And now I can buy the building I heard it in… but I don’t buy depreciating assets, and those are all schools.

Alex Charfen



Because most people are unhappy doesn’t mean you need to be… There is more available.

Peter Harris



Lean on your strengths to counter your weaknesses.

Tabitha Germain



Blockchain is like Twitter for your bank account.

Vladimir Kolesnikov



There are no shortcuts... Exhaustion is when creativity starts. If you put people in a room, you take them past their endurance level—and that can come in the third hour, the fifteenth hour, or the twenty-fourth hour... Break it down and down again. That moment is the beginning of something that's of value... You can't relax in very frustrating times

Barry Diller



Charisma is a learnable skill... Made up of three things. The first one is the effective use is tonality. How you say what you say so that you sound interesting, you sound enthusiastic, you sound empathetic, and—through your tone of voice—people can get the emotions that you are feeling inside and you're trying to portray. The second would be the effective or the appropriate use of body language... How do you move your body as you speak?... How do you move your body while you listen... All great communicators give you a sense that they care with a magnetic zone... And number three, which could be the most difficult of all, is not saying stupid shit... Train yourself.

If it ain't broke, make damn sure it doesn't break.

A real estate ETF might have 10% in AAPL stock. Why? Because it is popular and no one would question a manger who makes a popular decision. But a manager who makes unpopular or questionable moves, even successfully, will bring the gaze of popular opinion in his or her direction. Combine this tendency to follow the popular trend with job performance in an environment free of a true fiduciary reasonability to the clients and ultimately the seeds are sown for poor returns at the expense of the client.

Kimon Inglessis



You are far more likely to win when you are selective about the races you enter. Most of our failures are in races for which others enter us. Most of our success come from races we ourselves want to enter.

Richard Koch



Most people have too many friends and do not enjoy an appropriately selected and reinforced inner circle. Many people have the wrong life partners—and even more do not nurture the right life partner properly.

Richard Koch



Few people spend enough time and thought cultivating their own happiness. They seek indirect goals, like money and promotion, they may be difficult to attain and will prove when they are attained to be extremely inefficient sources of happiness. Not only is happiness not money, it is not even like money. Money not spent can be saved and invested and, through the magic of compound interest, multiplied. But happiness not spent does not lead to happiness tomorrow.

Richard Koch



You want to frame something and work on it as an extension of what you already understand, not a completely different thing... Things that we understand really well. Our long-term goals... That's the only way to build an organization.

All of the success I've had in life is due to meditation.

Ray Dalio



The way to get good at something fast is you have to try. Then once you try, you have to be bad, and then you can be good, and then you can be great. The only way to be good is first to be bad. And the only way to be bad is first to try.

Jim Edwards



Many of the things we do absorb energy but are worse than useless. Worry is a prime example. Worry is never useful.

[If someone] with twenty-five years of experience writes a book... and you buy the book, you can learn in a day or so of reading what it took him twenty years to accumulate... Most of the successful professionals I know are compulsive information collectors. You should be one, too.

Robert Bly

Dan Lok



60% of a book is explanation and 40% is information... Don't waste time learning what you already understand.

More with less is easy to maintain and extend. A bit of upfront thinking is a small price for a huge lifetime reward.

Richard Koch



Failure is a prerequisite to learning.

Eric Ries



When you say to somebody 'live below your means,' you wipe their spirit out. It's like saying to somebody, 'if you want to lose weight, go on a starvation diet.' It doesn't make you healthier... I want to feed my brain so I can expand my means... Do better every day.

Robert Kiyosaki



I have a friend who was not successful at all... who would only fly first class... He needed that mentally because mentally he wanted to think he was the best. And that's it. Even though he didn't have much money at the time... he would always fly... But it put him in a good state of mind, and he became a very very successful guy... Whatever it takes to train that [confidence].

Donald Trump



It's very important to have a mentor... It let me focus on my long-term goal. If I want to be that person. If I want to do that thing. What do I have to do now? Your actions make you who you want to become.

Daniel Uzamire



Easy isn't always good.... Go out of your way to succeed... It's all you in Nigeria. Anywhere... Come together and form groups... They will murder you if you steal... Civilians will shove you into a tire and set you on fire.

It is easier to start a hard company than an easy company.

Being original is overrated. The most creative minds in the world... are just better at rearrangement.

You can bring someone to a specific point to do what you want then to do, but you can't force them to do it.

Brad Pitt



Anybody who talks about how much money they have usually doesn’t have any. 

Frank Kern



I don’t have a bucket list. I just do things.

John Wooten



People have an amazing ability to live down to low expectations. If you run your ship with the conviction that everyone’s a slacker, your employees will put all their ingenuity into proving you right. If you view those who work under you as capable adults who will push themselves to excel even when you’re not breathing down their necks, they’ll delight you in return.

Jason Fried and David Hasson



You are not a platform until the people building on you make more money than you do.

Bill Gates



Everything can be done linearly or exponentially. Doing something the same way as everybody else gives you no advantage. Using approaches no one else uses gives you unequal advantages. Everything we do in business has the capacity to grow exponentially... You can get a higher yield with less resources... less time... less capital... less risk... and less effort.

Jay Abrraham



You're known for competencies. You're known as a type of person.

I think the financial industry is a service industry; it should serve others before it serves itself.

Christine Lagarde



If you’re doing something you love, you’re more likely to put your all into it, and that generally equates to making money.

Warren Buffet



The past is gone. The best of your life is the rest of your life.

Frank Kern



Many seminars have been taught, books written, lessons given, and knowledge passed on when it comes to having a proper mental preparation required to succeed... In fact, in my opinion, it should be mentioned in every single business book there is. I have witnessed geniuses fail simply because they didn't think they could do it. Likewise, I have watched idiots become wildly successful because they knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that they’d become successful.

Casey Denman



A mindset is a primary state of mind that you find yourself in day in and day out. It's what you expect from life, what you think about, and usually it's what you attract. If you continually worry about investing, the chance of making a bad investment, or losing money instead of trusting your training and knowledge, it's very possible you'll get involved in an investment haphazardly.

Casey Denman



Most people who lead abundant lives are very optimistic people. Not because their money makes them optimistic, but because their optimism made them money. 

Casey Denman



What makes a great Wall Streeter, especially on the trading, brokerage, and money management sides of the business are athletes. Nonathletes are fine, but the ones who really shine and become something on the Street are those who were a part of a team, understand competition, and know the difference between winning and losing. On the Street, the score is kept every day, and only people who played or play sports competitively truly understand what that means and how important it is to success.

Daniel Strachman



In trading, you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money. And if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money. I believe that anyone who has made money in trading has to experience horrendous pain at some point. Trading is like working with electricity, you can get an electric shock. With that porkbelly trade and other trades, I felt the electric shock and the fear that comes with it. That led to my attitude of 'let me show you what I think and please knock the hell out of it.' I learned about the math of investing.

Ray Dalio



What is a legacy? It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. 

Alexander Hamilton



While I enjoyed being a lawyer, I found that I was really passionate about something that had absolutely nothing to do with anything I had learned in school... In fact, everything that school had been teaching me was a complete waste of time...  Today is day one for the rest of your life. You have got to discover for yourself what you love to do. And it’s not necessarily what you’ve spent your entire life studying or working toward. Your work is going to be a very big part of your life. And, as such, it is incredibly important that you commit yourself to doing great work. If you’re lucky like me, you’ll find your path... If you don’t truly love the work that you do, move on and don’t stop looking until you find what you’re truly passionate about.

The most dangerous time in markets is when you’re crushing it because you’re gonna start doing less work, start managing risk less… may start treating people poorly.

We've all got some kind of expiration date on our lives. Fly too close to the sun for too long, and you'll be unnoticed; find the right balance between flying just high enough, at just the right velocity, and you might just stay up there forever.

There's nothing sadder than to see someone get to be seventy-five or eight years old and look back regrettably because they pursued the wrong target.

Jay Abraham

 

We live in a culture that places tremendous value on independence and self-reliance. But knowing how and when to ask for help, especially when it's hard, is one of the most valuable lessons you can learn. A great mentor can play an influential role in your personal life and the life of your business. Seek out a relationship with someone in your community whom you respect and trust.

Michael Parrish DuDell

 

The fastest way to get from where you are to where you want to be is to hire a coach. There is no faster way to get from where you are to where you want to be other than hiring a coach... When you pay somebody for their skill set to guide you through the process, there is a symbol of seriousness that allows them to support you through the process... A mentor has been there and mentor can show you the shortest path, but a coach can show you the fastest path. That's the difference between Google Maps and Waze... The mentor has been there and can say, "Don't do these three things, do this." But you have no idea if there's traffic on that road at that time. Mentors can always give you the shortest path because the have perspective, but coaches know what is working right now. If someone wanted to double the size of their business, I could probably help them do it much faster than they could do on their own.

All I had to do was hire my first coach ten years earlier, and the trajectory of my company would have been completely different. My life would have been completely different.

Sharran Srivatsaa

 

I had $1,568 in the bank, and the only reason why I know that number is that the cost to hire this coach was $1,500 a month... It was one of the biggest and scared decisions I made... Many many years later, I can tell you that I would have spent $15,000 to make that same decision knowing what I know now. That single decision to hire a mentor or hire a coach changed every aspect of my life... The things that I learned from that mentor bled into other aspects of my life. It wasn't just about business. It actually affected my relationships. It affected me personally. And now I can't image not having a mentor. I thought I was broke. I thought I was weird. I was paying somebody to teach me things that I should know inherently or that I should know, and I come to find out that sometimes we don't know those things inherently. Sometimes they're not natural to us, and it is very wise to hire a mentor. The more I looked into it the more I realized that the most successful people in the world in any category: the most successful musicians, the most successful athletes, the most successful investors, the most successful parents. People that are successful that have reached a level of greatness are coached and mentored and they never stop the mentoring. Tiger Woods... still has a hiring coach. Michael Jordan... had a shooting coach. Warren Buffet has investment coaches. Mentorship, what I found out, isn't for people that are broken. Mentorship is for people that want to excel. When you get to a certain level and you can't break through that, we call it the plateau, you need to bring somebody in that can bring you above that plateau... It's something I got really passionate about and wish I did earlier in my career... It's one of the greatest secrets of the successful. They are coached and mentored at every aspect and it never stops... I spent the last money in my bank account... and I would have done it again 100 times over to have the same result.

Ryan Jaden

 

The plateaus are where the death starts, so I need to keep the focus on possibility and potential.

Grant Cardone

 

If you aren't serious enough to invest in your business [or yourself], who else will be?

Misha Wilson

 

I got resourceful and actually came up with well over $10,000 by borrowing from someone. I didn't have any credit. No credit lines. Didn't have any financing options. None of it. But I came up with the money and started that mentorship program. It totally changed my life. Very shortly after that I built my first six-figure per year business and I've just kind of gone from there... God, I wish I would have done it earlier... There's a huge cost to not being started with mentoring.

Misha Wilson

 

Success is on the other side of a yes [that results in temporary discomfort]. Nothing is on the other side of a no.

Ryan Jaden

 

Don't be afraid to spend money. It's a mindset issue. Don't be afraid to invest in yourself... You should invest in yourself more than anything. The more you invest in yourself, the more you become. The more you become, the more you can give back to others.

Rich Guzman

 

Seek mentors. I have lot of people I talk to on a regular basis, people I talk to all the time, people who have been there and done that.
